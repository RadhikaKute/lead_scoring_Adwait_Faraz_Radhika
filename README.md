# Lead Scoring Case Study
## Problem Statement:
X Education has a low lead conversion rate of 30%. 
The Company wishes to identify the most promising leads, also known as "hot leads," in order to increase the lead conversion rate to 80%.

The company requires us to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. 
The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

The model will be trained on a historical dataset of leads. The model will then be used to score new leads.
The sales team will focus their efforts on the leads with the highest lead scores. This will help to increase the lead conversion rate.

## Goal:
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
